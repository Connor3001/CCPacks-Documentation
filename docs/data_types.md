# Data Types

Data types are used everywhere in the JSON files. Every field in a JSON has to have a specific type. For example, a page about a specific power type tells you which fields are supported and which data type they need to have.

* [Array](array)
* [Boolean](boolean)
* [Float](float)
* [Integer](integer)
* [Object](object)
* [String](string)
* [Identifier](identifier)
* [Key](key)
