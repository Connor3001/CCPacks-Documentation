# Power Types

Powers are what grants functionality to the player! Each power has a type, specified with
a `type` field in the JSON. Which type a power is defines which other fields it requires and supports.

Unless stated otherwise, each power type supports a `condition` field with an [entity condition](entity_conditions). See [Power JSON](power_json.md) for more details.
