### Installing Custom Content Packs

Because of the fact that CCPacks add new content to the game, this content cannot be loaded mid-game. This means that in order to install a CCPack, you must put it in your files *before* you launch the game.

In order to install the packs, you need to go into your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder. This can be done in game (but requires a restart), or by using your file explorer to traverse to `%appdata/.minecraft/resourcepacks%`.

The pack can be in either the zip format, or extracted to a directory.

After it has been installed. You can launch the game. If your game was already open, you will have to restart the game in order for the content to be registered.
