# Welcome to the Unofficial Apoli documentation!

This page will hopefully contain all the information you need to make your own data packs with the Apoli Library.

Apoli is a Minecraft modding library developed for Fabric that allows datapack developers to create powers and effects that players can obtain usually through the use of other mods or commands.

Visit [this link](https://github.com/apace100/apoli) to download the mod!

## General information

-   Most powers are configurable via data packs. You can also add new powers via data packs. This wiki should help you as a reference for everything important, and will maybe contain a few useful tutorials in the future.
-   You are welcome to join the [Origins Discord server](https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3) if you want to talk about the Origins mod and the Apoli library, making data packs or add-ons for the mod, or to discover servers which use the mod which are sometimes advertised there.
