# Welcome to the documentation for the CCPacks Mod!

This mod gives the developers the ability to create new Custom Content in Minecraft, without needing to know Java.

Huge thanks to Apace, who created the libraries that allow CCPacks to have as many features as it does.


# General information
- All custom content supports the Apoli Power system!
- These powers are identical to the powers used in the Origins Mod, but are granted via the use of items, blocks etc.
- The Origins mod is not required for CCPacks to work, although using both mods together allows for more possibilities in both.
- Check out our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/QRbhVGN5Jn) for distributing and sharing your creations!
