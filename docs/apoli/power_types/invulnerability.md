# Invulnerability

[Power Type](../power_types.md).

Provides damage immunity to specific damage sources.

**Note:** Does NOT support conditions depending on the damage amount, as this is a generic invulnerability power. Use [Modify Damage Taken](modify_damage_taken.md) with an [Attribute Modifier](../data_types/attribute_modifier.md) which multiplies by 0 (`multiply_total` as the `operation` and `-1` as the `value`) if you need that.

Type ID: `origins:invulnerability`

### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`damage_condition` | [Damage Condition](../damage_conditions.md) | | Specifies which damage the player will be immune to.

### Example
```json
{
  	"type": "origins:invulnerability",
	"damage_condition": {
		"type": "origins:name",
		"name": "fall"
	}
}
```
Makes the player immune to fall damage.
