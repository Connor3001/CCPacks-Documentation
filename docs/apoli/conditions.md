# Conditions

Conditions, along-side [Actions](actions.md) are Origins' main way of defining more complex functionality of powers in the new data-driven system. They were introduced in version 0.4.0, which is the update that made powers data-driven.

They are grouped by the type of object they act on, such as living beings, blocks or items:

## List

* [Entity Conditions](entity_conditions.md)
* [Block Conditions](block_conditions.md)
* [Item Conditions](item_conditions.md)
* [Damage Conditions](damage_conditions.md)
* [Fluid Conditions](fluid_conditions.md)
* [Biome Conditions](biome_conditions.md)
* [Meta Conditions](meta_conditions.md) are conditions that can be used in any other condition type.
